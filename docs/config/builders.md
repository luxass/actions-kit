# Builders

Builders are the core of Actions Kit. They define how the action is built.

By default `Rspack` is used as the builder.

The following builders are available:

- [ESBuild](/builders/esbuild) - Build the action using ESBuild.
- [Rolldown](/builders/rolldown) - Build the action using Rolldown.
- [Rollup](/builders/rollup) - Build the action using Rollup.
- [Rspack](/builders/rspack) - Build the action using Rspack.
- [Vite](/builders/vite) - Build the action using Vite.
- [Webpack](/builders/webpack) - Build the action using Webpack.
